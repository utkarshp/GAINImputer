# GAINImputer
PyTorch implementation with sklearn interface of GAIN: Missing Data Imputation using Generative Adversarial Nets by Jinsung Yoon, James Jordan, Mihaela van der Schaar.

This class is based on the original PyTorch implementation of the code available here: https://github.com/dhanajitb/GAIN-Pytorch/tree/master, which in turn is an adaptation of the original Tensorflow implementation by the authors here: https://github.com/jsyoon0823/GAIN.
